# About

Hey, I'm Muad 👋🏽

DevOps • Security • DevSecOps

I'm that overanalyzing person who builds layers of protection and redundancies because "better safe than sorry" is basically what's on my brain constantly.

Most of my work happens in private repos, but I drop useful stuff here when it can help the community and something I'm working on.

Currently securing things and automating the boring parts.
